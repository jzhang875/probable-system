# X-Team 23 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We assign tasks equally to the members
We help each other so that we do not need to reassign the task.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
By reaching to each other on a group chat


## How will you communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
By meeting the group memebers and try to figure out together


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
By keep reminding each other breforhand.
Difficulties will be sent to members with related experience.
